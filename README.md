## What is this?

- We need to learn this stuff, so why not learn this together?

- We will be meeting every Monday, Wednesday, Friday morning to discuss _anything_ related to Scala, so please come prepared, enthusiastic, bring your questions and your suggestions.

- __When?__ 8:50-9:20 every day. __Where?__ North Meeting Room (5th floor)

- __Who is this for?__ Everybody is welcome, but especially those of us who are new to this.

- __Can I volunteer to facilitate a lesson?__ __YES!!! Please :)__

## This Repo

- This repo will hold a series of exercises on particular topics. 
    - The topic and questions for the next lesson can be found here, in the __/src__ and in __/test/scala__ dirs. 
    
- The exercises are meant as __HOMEWORK__ - we will be discussing solutions and approaches the next morning. Come prepared for this to be effective.

- We'll figure out a way to reflect everybody's work in this repo, if we need to.

- We'll see how to make it work for people who need to remote in.


### Come hungry.
